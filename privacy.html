    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 5, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our app. By
        using the app, you consent to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Identifiers:</strong> Name, email address, or other credentials for account creation.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Notes, collections, shared links, comments, and other items you
            create or interact with.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> App usage, feature interactions, session duration, and navigation behavior.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, OS, identifiers, crash logs, and diagnostics.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address and Metadata:</strong> Collected for logging, security, and performance analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. IP Address Logging</h2>
    <p>We may log your IP address during server interactions. This data is handled by our backend provider (e.g.,
        Supabase) and used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Security and stability of services</li>
        <li>Abuse and fraud prevention</li>
        <li>Performance and usage monitoring</li>
        <li>Technical troubleshooting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use this data to personally identify you unless required for safety, security, or legal reasons.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To deliver and maintain app features</li>
        <li>To sync data across devices</li>
        <li>To enhance and personalize the user experience</li>
        <li>To analyze performance and usability</li>
        <li>To detect and address technical problems or abuse</li>
        <li>To enforce our Terms and Community Guidelines</li>
        <li>To review and resolve reports made by users</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Report and Block System</h2>
    <p>We provide tools to report and block users or content to maintain a safe environment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Report System:</strong> Reports contain metadata such as who reported, what was reported, when, and
            the reason (if provided). This data helps us identify policy violations.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Block System:</strong> When you block someone, we store that relationship to prevent further
            interaction from the blocked user.
        </li>
        <li>All report and block data is securely stored and accessed only for moderation, abuse prevention, or legal
            response.
        </li>
        <li>Misuse of the report system may lead to account restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. Data is only shared with third parties as necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Host and store your data (e.g., Supabase)</li>
        <li>Provide analytics and crash reporting</li>
        <li>Moderate content (if needed)</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data as long as needed to provide services or meet legal requirements. Report and block data may be
        kept longer for audit or abuse investigation purposes.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from minors. If you
        believe a child has shared data with us, please contact us to delete it.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable measures to protect your data. However, no internet system is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact
        us using the details below.</p>
