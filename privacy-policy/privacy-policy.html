<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective Date: 28.08.2025</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our app. By using the app, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <li>Usage data and device information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. IP Address Logging</h2>
<p>
    We may collect and log IP addresses as part of routine server interactions and security measures. This data is handled by our backend service provider (e.g., Supabase) and may be used for performance monitoring, fraud prevention, and troubleshooting. We do not use this information to personally identify users.
</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
    We do not sell or rent your personal data. Your data may be shared with third-party services only as required to operate and improve the app (e.g., hosting, storage, and analytics providers).
</p>

<h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
    Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete that information.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>
    We take appropriate security measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no system is completely secure.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
